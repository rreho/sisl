Environment variables
=====================

sisl understands some environment variables that may be used to tweak, or change
the default behaviour of sisl.

Here we list the different options:


``SISL_NUM_PROCS = 1``
   Default the number of processors used in parallel calculations.
   Currently only certain Brillouin zone operations has this enabled.

   Please test this for your machine before relying on it giving a lot
   of performance. Especially in conjunction with the ``OMP_NUM_THREADS``
   flag for OpenMP in linear algebra libraries.
   Benchmark and see if it actually improves (certain combinations will
   severly hurt performance, while others will greatly improve performance).
   This value together with ``OMP_NUM_THREADS`` and ``SISL_PAR_CHUNKSIZE``
   should be tuned for your case study.

   It is *very* easy to encounter deadlocks when using parallel processing in
   `sisl`. The main problem is the interplay between the BLAS library and the
   threading in the multiprocessing library. Always try first by maximizing
   ``SISL_NUM_PROCS`` and set ``OMP_NUM_THREADS=1`` to test whether it works
   on your machine, then further tuning can be done by ensuring that
   ``SISL_NUM_PROCS * OMP_NUM_THREADS <= CORES``.

   Generally one can get the maximum number of cores by:

   .. code-block:: python

      import os
      nprocs = len(os.sched_getaffinity(0))
      # If your CPU has hyper-threads, then you have to divide by 2:
      nprocs = nprocs // 2

``SISL_PAR_CHUNKSIZE = 0.2``
   Default size of chunk for each processor when running parallel things.

   The chunksize can be an `int`, in which case it is directly determining
   the chunksize.
   If it is a `float`, it is understood as the fraction of chunks each
   processor will get, so a chunksize of ``0.5`` means that each processor
   gets 2 chunks (the actual chunksize will be adjusted depending on the number
   of iterations). For ``0.1``, it results in 10 chunks per processor.

   When doing parallel jobs the chunksize can greatly improve efficiency.
   For example a chunksize of 1 and 2 processors for a brillouinzone object
   means an execution like this:

   .. code-block:: shell

      <initialization>
      proc-0: k[0]
      proc-1: k[1]
      <collection of results>
      proc-0: k[2]
      proc-1: k[3]
      <collection of results>
      ...

   With a chunksize of 2 it will look like:

   .. code-block:: shell

      <initialization>
      proc-0: k[0]
      proc-0: k[1]
      proc-1: k[2]
      proc-1: k[3]
      <collection of results>
      ...

   this can greatly improve performance, however, a too high chunksize can
   hurt performance, as well as a too low.
   A rule-of-thumb would be to select a chunksize such that
   the number of iterations is divisible by the chunksize.
   For `BrillouinZone` objects, the number of iterations is equivalent to the number
   of k-points.

``SISL_SHOW_PROGRESS = false``
   Certain sisl routines has a builtin progress bar. This variable can default
   whether or not those will be shown. It can be nice for *slow* brillouinzone calculations
   to see if progress is actually being made.

``SISL_IO_DEFAULT = ''``
   The default IO methods `sisl.get_sile` will select files with this file-endings.
   For instance there are many ``stdout`` file types (for each DFT code).
   Setting this to ``Siesta`` would force all files to first search for classes ending
   in ``Siesta`` (see `sisl.io` for class names).

``SISL_TMP = '.sisl_tmp'``
   certain internal methods of sisl will use a temporary folder for storing data.
   The default is a new folder in the currently executed directory.

``SISL_FILES_TESTS``
   Full path to a folder containing tests files. Primarily used for developers.

``SISL_CONFIGDIR = $HOME/.config/sisl``
   where certain configuration files should be stored.

   Currently not in use.

``SISL_LOG_FILE``
   if provided `sisl` will log to the provided file.

``SISL_LOG_LEVEL = "info"``
   the log-level used if writing to a log-file.
   The value will be taken from the `logging` module,
   so it should be a variable in that module.


Code specific environment variables
-----------------------------------

Siesta
^^^^^^

``SISL_UNIT_SIESTA = codata2018 | legacy``
   determine the default units for Siesta files.

   Since Siesta 5.0, the default units are updated to follow
   the CODATA 2018 values. This means that quite a bit of
   results changed. This will force the internal variables
   to be consistent with this.
