#             the axis along which the scan is performed. If not provided, it will scan along the axes that are not displayed.
#         start: float, optional
#             the starting value for the scan (in Angstrom).
#             Make sure this value is inside the range of the unit cell, otherwise it will fail.

#         num: int , optional
#             the number of steps that you want the scan to consist of.

#             If `step` is passed, this argument is ignored.

#             Note that the grid is only stored once, so having a big number of steps is not that big of a deal.
#         breakpoints: array-like, optional
#             the discrete points of the scan. To be used if you don't want regular steps.
#             If the last step is exactly the length of the cell, it will be moved one dcell back to avoid errors.
