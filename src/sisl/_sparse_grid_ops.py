    in the coeffs array (which potentially contains information for interactions between cells) for the ij pair
    with that offset.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data:
        The data values of the sparse matrix
    ptr:
        The array with pointers to the start of each row for the sparse matrix.
    col:
        The array containing the column index for each value in the sparse matrix.
    coeffs:
        The dense matrix containing weights for all possible products.
    uc_ncol:
        Number of columns for each unit cell.
    reduce_factor:
        Each row index is integer divided (//) by this factor to get the row index where
        the result should be stored.
    grid_shape:
        If you want to transpose the grid indices before reducing it, you need to specify
        the (old) grid shape. If not, pass here an array of shape 0.
    new_axes:
        If you want to transpose the grid indices before reducing it, you need to specify
        the nex axes. As an example, [1, 2, 0] will move the first axis to the last dimension.

        If you don't want to transpose, pass an array of shape 0.
    out:
        The array where the output should be stored.
